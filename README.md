# mw-latexer

Converts mediawiki collection bundles (as generated by mw-bundler) to
beautiful PDFs (via [XeLaTeX][]).

[XeLaTeX]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX

## Installation

I'm using node 0.10.  Probably any recent node will work; I haven't tested
others.

Install the node package dependencies.
```
npm install
```

Install other system dependencies.
```
apt-get install texlive-xetex imagemagick
```

## Generating bundles

You may wish to install the `mw-bundler` package to create bundles
from wikipedia articles.  The below text assumes that you have done
so; ignore the `mw-bundler` references if you have bundles from
some other source.

## Running

To generate a PDF named `out.pdf` from the `en` wikipedia article
"United States":
```
mw-bundler -o us.zip --prefix en "United States"
bin/mw-latexer -o out.pdf us.zip
```

For debugging, preserving the XeTeX output is often useful:
```
bin/mw-latexer -o out.tex us.zip && xelatex out.tex
```

For other options, see:
```
bin/mw-latexer --help
```
